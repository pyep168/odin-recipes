        Steps:
    </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain
            excess grease. Stir in taco seasoning mix and water and simmer until beef mixture has thickened, 8 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread tortilla chips on the prepared baking sheet; top with Cheddar cheese and dot with refried beans and ground beef
            mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, watching carefully to prevent burning, 3 to 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Top nachos with salsa, sour cream, black olives, green onions, and jalapeno peppers.
        </li>
    </ol>
